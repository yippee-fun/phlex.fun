  - title: Fast enough
    icon: 🚀

    details: Package up components into Kits (Ruby modules) for easy reuse across projects.
  - title: Structural safety
    link: /miscellaneous/structural-safety
    icon: 🛡️
    details: Phlex is designed to structurally prevent cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - title: Sensible isolation
